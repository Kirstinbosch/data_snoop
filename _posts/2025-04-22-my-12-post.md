Terms: expectations of joint distributions (discrete, continuous), 

Expectation
important properties of expectations
1) The Expected Value of a Non-Random Quantity is Itself
  E[c]=c
  A constant doesn’t vary — no matter how many times you run the experiment, its value never changes. So the average of something that’s always the same… is just that thing.
2) Linearity of Expectation
   If 𝑋 and 𝑌 are random variables, and 𝑎,𝑏 are constants, then:
   E[aX+bY+c]=aE[X]+bE[Y]+c
   This holds regardless of whether 𝑋 and 𝑌 are independent or dependent — which is huge.
