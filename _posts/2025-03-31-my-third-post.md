Day 2.
Topics covered: counting methods [ordered pairs/ k-tuples, permutations (ordered arrangement of objects -partial/ full), Combinations (unordered arrangement of objects), complementary events, independent events & multiplication principle, conditional probability, bayesian theory, partition of an event, law of total probability, tree diagram, two-way table)

Why multiplication makes sense in independence?

Probability of either event occuring is the multiple of the two.
ex: flipping a coin and rolling a die
probability of getting heads P(A) = 1/2
probability of rolling a 4 P(B) = 1/6
Since they are both independent events --> 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12
Intuitively, there are two outcomes for coin tosses and 6 outcomes for rolling a die therefore the total number of combinations is 6*2 = 12. Only one of the outcomes (H,4) is the desired outcome making it 1/12
What if we didnt multiply?
If we added the probabilities, we would be overcounting. Addition only used when the events are mutually exclusive.

Bayesian and Conditional Probability:
bayesian --> MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive) is a core principle, requires a partition of events as we need to calculate the total probability (not isolated)
conditional --> useful but not required, focuses on a specific conidition & does not require all possible cases (isolated)

*MECE framework used in problem-solving, consulting & stats to break down problems into clear, non-overlapping, complete components making it easier to analyse and solve.
