Terms: joint distributions, multivariate hyper-geomteric distribution, multivariate uniform distribution, multivariate normal distribution, marginal distributions (for jointly discrete/ continuous random variables), independent random variables

Independent Random Variables:
If you have two random variables, X and Y, you can talk about their joint probability distribution. This shows the probability of both events happening at the same time.
P(X=x, Y=y) is the probability that X takes valu x and Y takes value y.

Two random variables X and Y are independent if:
P(X=x, Y=y) = P(X=x).P(Y=y) for all values x and y. This means that knowing the outcome of X gives no information about Y, and vice versa.
ex: rolling two die
X: result of first die
Y: result of second die
As each roll is independent:
P(X=2, Y=5) = P(X=2).P(Y=5)= 1/6. 1/6 = 1/36

For continuous variables, the same idea holds with density functions

How to check for independence?
--> check the joint distributions
--> use conditional probability: if P(X|Y) = P(X), then X and Y are inpdendent.
--> Covariance/correlation: zero correlation does not imply independence, but independence does imply zero correlation

You can check for independence by comparing the joint distribution to the product of marginals
example: 
X: whether a person owns a dog
X = 1 (yes), X = 0 (no)
Y: whether the same person exercises daily
Y = 1 (yes), Y = 0 (no)

Conditional Joint Distribution:
Gives the probability of two variables together, given that some condition is true about one(or more)variables.
"What's the probability of X = x and Y= y given that something else (say Z = z or W > 5) is known?
Why use it?
--> analyse relationships under a specific condition
--> understand how dependence behaves when part of the system is known
--> feed into things like Bayes Theorem or expectations conditional on a variable
