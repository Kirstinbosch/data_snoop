Kolmogorov's Axioms:
(1) Axiom 1: Non-negativity
For any event A in the sample sapce P(A) > (or equal to) 0
Interpretation: Probability can't be negative

(2) Axiom 2: Normalization (Total Probability = 1)
P(S) = 1
where S is the sample space (the set of all possible outcomes)
Interpretation: something in the sample sape must happen, the total probability across all possible outcomes is exactly 1
* normalization: means adjusting or defining probabilities so that the total over the whole sample space is exactly 1 - ensures that the model is valid

(3) Axiom 3: Additivity (for mutually exclusive events)
If A and B are mutually exclusive (they cannot happen at once), then:
P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B)
Interpretation: If events can't happen at the same time (mutually exclusive), you can just add their probabilities

Common mistakes:
1. mistake: adding probabilitieas of events that are not mutually exclusive
wrong: P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) even when A and B can happen together
why its wrong: if A and B can both happen, the overlap gets counted twice.
correct: P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) -P(A intersection B)

Mutually exclusive (cannot happen at the same time):
A intersection B = 0
Independent (knowing tone happened does not change the probability of the other
P(A intersection B) = P(A) * P(B) 
If A and B are mutually exclusive and both have non-zero probability, they cannot be independent. Because if A happens, then P(B|A) = 0, not P(B)
example:rolling a six-sided die
A = rolling a 2 P(A) = 1/6
B = rolling a 5 P(B) = 1/6
these events are mutually exclusive: you cant roll a 2 and a 5 at the same time --> A intersection B = 0 & non-zero
check for independence:
Compute P(A intersection B)
Since A and B are mutually exclusive --> P(A intersection B) = 0
check for independence
If A and B were independent --> P(A intersection B) = P(A) * P(B)
P(A) * P(B) = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1 /36
but we just saw that P(A intersection B) = 0, not 1/36
So A and B cannot be independent
Intuition: if A happens (roll 2), then B cannot happen - because they are mutually exclusive. Meaning:
P(B|A) = 0
but for independent events we require:
P(B|A) = P(B) 
and its not true here
Conclusion:
Two events cannot be both mutually excluysive & 
independent (unless one of them has a probability 0

Summary:
Mutually exclusive:
P(A intersection B) = 0
You can add up mutually exclusive events: P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) if P(A intersection B) = 0
the total probability of any of them happening is just the sum of their individual probailities
Asking "What is the chance that any of these events occur?"

Independence:
P(A n B) = P(A) * P(B)
You cant just add up independent events due to the overlap (double counting)
P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B)

When deciding which counting formula to use:
Does order matter? Permutation
Are roles assigned? (like president, VP,...)? permutation
Is it a group, team, or subset? Combination

Permutation with repetition vs permutation without repetition:
1. Are you allowed to re-use elements? --> repetition
ex: creating a pin or password with digits or letters
2. If no, then it's a permutation without repetition
ex: arranging books on a shelf, or assigning unique roles

How to spot "repetition allowed": 'keywords'
+ can repeat, unlimitied use, choose without replacement
How to spot "no repetition":
+ different elements, no duplicates, can only be chosen once, without replacement

Effect on counting:
permutation without repetition n! / (n-k)! 
permutation with repetition n(power of r) (r= each of r positions chosen independently)

Summary thought pattern:
First: Does order matter?
→ No → Combination
→ Yes → Permutation

Second (if permutation): Are repeats allowed?
→ Yes → Permutation with repetition → 𝑛(power of r)

 
→ No → Permutation without repetition → P(n,r)
