Three approaches to calculating probabilities between two finite numbers in a normal distribution:
(1) Using CDF and Standard Normal Tables
--> Convert raw values to z-scores 
--> Use a Z-table (or calc) to find cumulative probabilities
--> Subtract the two probabilities to get the final result
(2) Using the exact probability density function
--> Integrate the crazy function
(3) Use symmetric properties if working with standard normal distribution
