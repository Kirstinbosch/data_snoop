Constants & Variance:

(1) Constants vs. Random Variables:
E[c] = c
--> Var(c) = E[(c - E[c])sqaured] --> Var(c) = E[0] = 0
If something never changes, it has no variability

(2) If we add a constant to a random variable, it does not affect its variance (since we use the linearity of expectation)

(3) If we multiply a random variable by a constant, then its variance may change.
a (2)â‹…Var(X)

Covariance: E[XY] - E[X].E[Y]
(1) Var[X+Y] = Var[X] + Var[Y] + 2Cov(X,Y)
(2) Var(aX+bY) = a(squared)Var[X] + b(squared)Var[Y] + 2abCov(X,Y)
