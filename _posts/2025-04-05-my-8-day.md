Terms: exponential distribution

Exponential & Poisson distributions:
--> The Poisson and exponential distributions are like best friends:
- The Poisson tells you how many events happen in a given time.
- The Exponential tells you how long you wait between those events.
- It just means:
ðŸ‘‰ If events happen randomly at a steady rate (Poisson), then the time between each event is exponentially distributed.
