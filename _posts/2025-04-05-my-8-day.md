Terms: exponential distribution, beta distribution, gamma distribution, joint distributions, joint PMFs, joint CDFs, two-way table, marginal probability mass function, 

Exponential & Poisson distributions:
--> The Poisson and exponential distributions are like best friends:
- The Poisson tells you how many events happen in a given time.
- The Exponential tells you how long you wait between those events.
- It just means:
👉 If events happen randomly at a steady rate (Poisson), then the time between each event is exponentially distributed.

Beta distribution:
--> helps us describe our uncertainty about a probability. It doesn’t give you a single fixed number — it gives you a whole range of possibilities, showing which ones are more or less likely
--> What’s the probability that the success rate of this thing is around 70%?
--> by changing α and β, you can make the Beta distribution:
Flat (no idea what the probability is),
Peaky (strong belief around a value),
Skewed (leaning toward 0 or 1),
Or anything in between.

Gamma Distribution:
The Gamma distribution is a continuous probability distribution used to model waiting times — like how long it takes for multiple events to happen.
It’s kind of a generalization of the Exponential distribution, which only models the time until one event happens
Let’s say lightning strikes a town on average once every 10 days.
The Exponential distribution can model:
“How long until the next lightning strike?”
The Gamma distribution can model:
“How long until the 3rd lightning strike?”

Weibull distribution:
The Weibull distribution is a continuous probability distribution used to model time until something fails — like a machine breaking down, a lightbulb burning out, or a person recovering.It’s like the Swiss Army knife of lifetime modeling — because it can model many types of behavior depending on its shape.
k<1	Failure rate decreases over time — early failures (e.g. electronics out of the box)
𝑘=1 Constant failure rate — behaves like the Exponential distribution
𝑘>1 Failure rate increases — wear and tear over time (e.g. aging machinery)
--> Chain rule integration
