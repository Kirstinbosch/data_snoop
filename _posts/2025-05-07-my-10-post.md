Terms: conditional distributions, expectation / expected value, empirical expected value,  (sample) mean, (sample) variance, sample standard deviation, sample covariance, sample correlation, expected value of a function, marginal expectations, 

Covariance & Correlation:
Covariance tells you how two variables change together. Are they increasing together? Does one go up when the other goes down? Covariance has units — if 𝑋 is in dollars and 𝑌
is in inches, the covariance is in dollar-inches. So it's not standardized.
Correlation is the standardized version of covariance — it tells you how strong and in what direction the linear relationship is, without units. Because it’s unitless and bounded, correlation is easier to interpret across different contexts.

Properties of Expectation:
(1) the expected value of a non-random quantity is itself. Think of rolling a die that always shows 5. The expected value? Still 5
(2) Linearity of Expectation: E[aX+bY]=aE[X]+bE[Y]. You can pull out constants and split up sums inside the expectation. You don’t need independence or any other fancy conditions — this always holds, even if 𝑋 and 𝑌 are dependent.
