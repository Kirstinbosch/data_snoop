Moment generating functions:
+ A useful property of momernt generating functions is that they make it easy to handle sums of independent random variables
If you have independent random variables X(1), X(2), X(3)....  and you want to understand the distribution or moments of their sum
S = X(1) + X(2) + X (3) ....
Then the MGF of the sum is the product of the individual MGFs.
This only works if the X(i) are independent

Why is this useful?
Much easier math:
Instead of trying to calculate expectations or variances of a complex sum directly, you can just multiply MGFs and then differentiate to get moments.
Identifying distributions:
Sometimes, the product of MGFs turns out to be the MGF of a known distribution — so you immediately know what distribution the sum follows.
Central Limit Theorem:
MGFs are used to help prove the Central Limit Theorem, which says that the sum of many independent random variables tends toward a normal distribution under certain conditions
Think of MGFs as a “summary” of a random variable that’s easy to combine when you’re adding variables together — like a shortcut.
